<summary>Cascadium's troubleshooting</summary>
<h3>No applications launching</h3>

If no applications are launching at all, it's most likely an issue with either:

* `DISPLAY` not being set correctly
* `DISPLAY` being set fine, but its destination is not accessible from the WSL environment
* The X11 server isn't set up to allow access from external hosts (how to configure this will depend on your X11 server
  so please refer to their documentation)

Note that for this section, you can check which version of WSL you're using with:

    wsl.exe -l --verbose

#### Check WSL1 `$DISPLAY` variable

If you're running WSL1, the `DISPLAY` variable for WSL1 should simply be `localhost:0.0`
if this is the default distribution.

#### Check WSL2 `$DISPLAY` variable

Unfortunately for WSL2, it's a little more complicated for now, though I think they're
planning on fixing this. You'll need something like this to extract the correct host:

    export DISPLAY=$(grep -m 1 nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | awk '{print $2}'):0.0

### Firewall Rules

Then you need to worry about the firewall. WSL comes up as a public network, but I wouldn't recommend
allowing all public network traffic to access your X server. So instead, you can go ahead and select
defaults when this sort of prompt comes up:

![Security Alert](https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher/raw/master/assets/security_alert.png)

Now, irritatingly this will actively add a block rule (rather than simply not add an allow rule) for public networks
which you will need to disable for the next step by going into Windows Defender Firewall -> Inbound Rules and
**disabling this block rule for TCP on the Public Network**.

If you don't do the above step, the Block rule will take precedence over the Allow allow rule and you won't get through.

Now, right click on Inbound Rules and select `New Rule...`, select TCP port 6000 (most likely) and select defaults. This
will open up your public network for this port... which is also not what you want. What you want is to only allow traffic
from the WSL subnet. So refresh the list, scroll to your recently created name, right click and go to properties. Now
under `Scope`, go to **Remote IP address**, Select `These IP addresses` and add in `172.16.0.0/12` to limit the subnets
which can access this port to the WSL subnet. It should look something like this:

![WSL Subnet Firewall Rule](https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher/raw/master/assets/firewall_rule_wsl_subnet.png)

Alternatively you *could* just disable the entire firewall for WSL, but that adds a firewall warning that constantly
irritates me:

    powershell.exe -Command "Set-NetFirewallProfile -DisabledInterfaceAliases \"vEthernet (WSL)\""

### Application X not working

Does the application use dbus? If so, it's recommended to put something like this in your `.bashrc` to satisfy the many
applications which depend on dbus to function:

    dbus_status=$(service dbus status)
    if [[ $dbus_status = *"is not running"* ]]; then
      sudo service dbus --full-restart
    fi

Also check that the `.bashrc` tweaks are added **before any nastiness** like this in your `.bashrc` which would prevent `DISPLAY` from being set:

    # If not running interactively, don't do anything
    [ -z "$PS1" ] && return

You can do similar with `docker` or any other service which you will need access to, but won't necessarily already be
running in a vanilla WSL installation.

To debug further, you can run the shortcut directly from the command line from a `cmd` shell:

    wsl.exe -d <your-wsl-distro> -u <your-wsl-user> -- source ~/.bashrc ; env; xterm

Replacing xterm with whatever command you're trying to launch. Note the `env` command will
print out all environment variables set before running `xterm` in this example, so this should
help you double check if `DISPLAY` is really set correctly.

<div class="post-text" itemprop="text">
<h1>TL;DR:</h1>

<p>Add the following to your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint prettyprinted" style=""><code><span class="pln">export DISPLAY</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln">$</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">awk </span><span class="str">'/nameserver / {print $2; exit}'</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">etc</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">resolv</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">conf </span><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pun">&gt;/</span><span class="pln">dev</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">null</span><span class="pun">):</span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pln">
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="lit">1</span></code></pre>

<p><strong>Enable Public Access</strong> on your X11 server for Windows.*</p>

<p>Add a separate <strong>inbound rule</strong> for <strong>TCP port 6000</strong> to the windows firewall in order to allow WSL access to the X server, as described by the <a href="https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher#firewall-rules" rel="noreferrer">wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher</a> people.</p>

<hr>

<p>As pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/dq541z/megathread_if_you_are_using_wsl2_networking_is/" rel="noreferrer">by WSL_subreddit_mod on reddit</a> and as you can read in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-faq#will-wsl-2-be-able-to-use-networking-applications" rel="noreferrer">Microsoft's documentation on WSL2</a>, the WSL2 architecture uses virtualized network components. This means that WSL2 has a different IP address than the host machine.
This explains why the X11 forwarding settings of WSL1 cannot simply be transferred to WSL2.</p>

<p>On the Ubuntu Wiki page about WSL you can already find a configuration adapted for WSL2 under <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL#Running_Graphical_Applications" rel="noreferrer">Running Graphical Applications</a>. A similar configuration is also suggested by the above mentioned Reddit User, who also contributes another part of the solution: Enable Public Access on the X11 server under Windows.</p>

<p>This means add the following to your <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre class="lang-bash prettyprint prettyprinted" style=""><code><span class="pln">export DISPLAY</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln">$</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">awk </span><span class="str">'/nameserver / {print $2; exit}'</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">etc</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">resolv</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">conf </span><span class="lit">2</span><span class="pun">&gt;/</span><span class="pln">dev</span><span class="pun">/</span><span class="pln">null</span><span class="pun">):</span><span class="lit">0</span><span class="pln">
export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="lit">1</span></code></pre>

<p>And <strong>Enable Public Access</strong> on your X11 server for Windows.*</p>

<p>The most important part to enable X11 forwarding for WSL2 on Windows 10 is still missing: the Windows firewall blocks connections via the network interface configured for WSL by default.<br>
A separate <strong>inbound rule</strong> for <strong>TCP port 6000</strong> is required to allow WSL access to the X server. After the rule has been created, as described by the <a href="https://github.com/cascadium/wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher#firewall-rules" rel="noreferrer">wsl-windows-toolbar-launcher</a> people, the IP address range can be restricted to the WSL subnet in the settings of the newly created rule, under <strong>Scope</strong>: <em>172.16.0.0/12</em>.</p>

<p>*: If you use <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/" rel="noreferrer">VcXSrv</a> you can enable public access for your X server by disabling Access Control on the Extra Settings:<br>
<a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6C7AT.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/6C7AT.png" alt="Disable access control VcXSrv"></a><br>
Or by calling <code>vcxsrv.exe</code> directly with the <code>ac</code> flag: <code>vcxsrv.exe -ac</code> as pointed out by <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4106#issuecomment-502989345" rel="noreferrer">ameeno</a> on the github issue.</p>
